# Because we're using GitHub and Netlify for our hosting and
# authentication, backend configuration is fairly strightforward. You
# can start your config.yml file with these lines:
backend:
  name: github
  repo: thunderrabbit/journal-hugo
  branch: master

# By default, saving a post in the CMS interface will push a commit
# directly to the publication branch specified in backend. However,
# you also have the option to enable the Editorial Workflow, which
# adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts. To
# do this, add the following line to your config.yml:
publish_mode: editorial_workflow

# Netlify CMS allows users to upload images directly within the
# editor. For this to work, the CMS needs to know where to save
# them. If you already have an images folder in your project, you
# could use its path, possibly creating an uploads sub-folder. Here's
# an example that could work for a Hugo site:
media_folder: "static/images/uploads" # Media files will be stored in the repo
public_folder: "/images/uploads" # The src attribute for uploaded media will begin with /images/uploads

collections:
  - name: "journal" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/journal
    label: "Journal" # Used in the UI
    folder: "_posts/journal" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
    create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
    slug: "{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
    fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
      - {label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string"}
      - {label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "datetime"}
      - {label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown"}
